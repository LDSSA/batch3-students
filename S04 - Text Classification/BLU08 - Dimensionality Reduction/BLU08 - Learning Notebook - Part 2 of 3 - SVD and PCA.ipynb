    "\n",
    "The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method is a matrix decomposition or matrix factorization method, often used in applications such as compression, denoising and, our current topic, dimensionality reduction. All matrices have an SVD, making it more stable than other methods, such as the eigendecomposition. It is often presented with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which we are going to dive into later, but it can actually be used by itself, so let's start with that.\n",

    "The concept of SVD is relatively straightforward, but it is useful to understand the algebra behind it. I was actually going to assume you are fresh on your basic linear algebra (don't roll your eyes at me), skip the primers and jump right to business, but then again, a little refresher doesn't hurt. "

    "### Using SVD for dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know what's under the hood for SVD you probably want to make some use of this, so we will show you how to use it to perform feature reduction. It is actually quite simple. Let's take a step back. Because of the orthonormal property of our matrix $V$ we can write the SVD equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ AV=US $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We could now assume a truncation of k components (let's say, to 1 component) and get the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A\\begin{bmatrix}v_{11}\\\\v_{21}\\\\.\\\\.\\\\v_{n1}\\end{bmatrix} = s_{11}\\begin{bmatrix}u_{11}\\\\u_{21}\\\\.\\\\.\\\\u_{m1}\\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector $v$ is what we call a projection direction. The result of multiplying $X$ by this direction will result in a matrix with the same number of rows, but a smaller number of columns. Your data would now be projected in the first direction, this is, the one holding more variance. We could then get an approximation of X by computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A \\approx s_{11}\\begin{bmatrix}u_{11}\\\\u_{21}\\\\.\\\\.\\\\u_{m1}\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}v_{11}&v_{21}&.&.&v_{n1}\\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So you could now extend this for k components. By selecting the first k eigenvalues in S and assuming the others to be zero, you can use any subselection to reconstruct an approximate version of  A, with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A^{*}=U^{*}S^{*}{V^{*}}^{T} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $S^{*}$ is reduced to keep the first k eigenvalues and both $U^{*}$ and ${V^{*}}^{T}$ are reduced such that the dimensions are consistent. But this reconstruction isn't actually what we want. What we want is the projection of our data into a smaller space. In the same way that with 1 component multiplying by $V$ gave us the projected data, the same holds for k components, and all we need to do is project given $V$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A_r = A {V^{*}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By selecting the first k eigenvalues we ensure that  $A^{*}$ retains a disproportionately high amount of the variance of  A; we have in effect compressed the original information and represented it using fewer features. This is often used in NLP and known in that context as LSA - Latent Semantic Analysis\n",

This is a very good classifier with which to make a case for dimensionality reduction, since in a very high-dimensional space, the vector distances will most of the time be useless."

    "## 3. Principal Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of applying Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction is very similar to the one of SVD. In fact, SVD can be used just as a mathematical way of solving PCA and several numerical software libraries actually use SVD under the hood for their PCA routines - take as example the scikit-learn implementation. So what is PCA?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way as before, PCA aims to project the data into a lower dimensionality space, maximizing the variance of the projection along each component while minimizing the reconstruction error. We need to introduce a new concept - the covariance matrix and the correlation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our training set as a sequence of data points $\\{x^1, x^2, ..., x^K\\}$, a matrix $A$ that represents this dataset, and its mean as $\\mu = \\langle A \\rangle$, the covariance matrix is represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cov(A) = \\langle(A - \\mu)(A - \\mu)^T\\rangle = \\frac{(A - \\mu)(A - \\mu)^T}{n-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each row is a variable and each column an observation, and the correlation matrix is simply\n",
    "\n",
    "$$corr(A) = \\langle A A^T\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the study of principal components, we are interested in the variation of the data about the mean, so we normally first compute the centered data:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{A} = A - \\mu$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the result that $cov(\\bar{A}) = corr(\\bar{A})$, since the data will have zero mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1) Getting the first principal component\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define now the first component as projection of our data in some direction, writing it in function of some vector $\\textbf{w}$, where the scale doesn't matter since it does not affect the information contained in this component:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_1 = \\textbf{w}^T \\bar{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you still feel you need to review the basics of linear algebra, skip the next few equations from now and read directly the TL,DR)\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose this vector to maximize the variance of $p_1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2_{p_1} = \\langle p_1^2 \\rangle = \\langle (\\textbf{w}^T \\bar{A})(\\bar{A}^T\\textbf{w}) \\rangle = \\textbf{w}^T \\langle \\bar{A} \\bar{A}^T\\rangle \\textbf{w} = \\textbf{w}^T cov(A) \\textbf{w} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we define our vector $\\textbf{w}$ as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of our covariance matrix, with weights $w_i$ an eigenvectors $\\textbf{v}_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{w} = \\sum_i{w_i \\textbf{v}_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2_{p_1} = \\textbf{w}^T cov(A) (\\sum_i{w_i \\textbf{v}_i}) = \\sum_i{w_i \\textbf{w}^T cov(A)\\textbf{v}_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that one of the main definitions of eigenvectors is that their direction remains unchanged when applying the linear transformation ($Mv=\\lambda v$). Also note that, if $\\textbf{v}_i$ are vectors from an orthonormal basis, then $\\textbf{v}_i\\textbf{v}_j = 0$ and $\\textbf{v}_i\\textbf{v}_i = 1$, so we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{w}^T \\textbf{v}_i = w_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And our previous result simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2_{p_1} = \\sum_i{w_i \\lambda_i \\textbf{w}^T \\textbf{v}_i} = \\sum_i{w_i^2 \\lambda_i}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the quantity we want to maximize, constrained to $\\sum_i{w_i^2} = 1 $, so it should be clear that the maximum should be attained by setting $w_i = 1$ for the highest eigenvalue of $cov(A)$ and zero to all other weights. The first component will then be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_1 = \\textbf{v}_1 \\bar{A}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And a reconstruction of $\\bar{A}$ would be obtained by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bar{A} =  p_1 \\textbf{v}_1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the variance of this compoment will just be $\\sigma^2_{p_1} = \\lambda_i$ for the highest eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **TL,DR**: \n",
    "You can write out the first component as a function of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of $\\bar{A}$, if these are ordered from highest eigenvalue to lowest: \n",

    "## Final Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "We went through PCA and SVD on this notebook, which are methods you can try out in virtually any kind of data, whether your purpose is compression, visualization or just dimensionality reduction for classification. Some final notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - You must have realized by now that the performance of the methods is tightly coupled to the classifier you choose, and that not always methods that intuitively seem to be good will help you in your tasks. This doesn't mean that the methods aren't good, simply that you need to first think of what model are you focusing on and whether you really need  or expect an improvement over your baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - You can combine methods like this with other feature selection and engineering techniques you saw before. As in many fields, trying these techniques in different scenarios will give you a better sense on when these can be helpful or when they will actually be harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're finally done! Now rest a bit, go for a walk, and then dive into Part III. But before you go, I'll leave you with these questions:\n",
