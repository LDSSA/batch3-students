    "## Introduction\n",
    "This week we are going to simulate the real-life environment of the Hackathon! We will provide you with a dataset, some tips and you are going to train, validate and predict with a Recommender System using all the knowledge acquired throughout this specialization. This exercise is very similar to the Hackathon of the previous year.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "You have finished the Academy and you are hired as a Data Scientist in Recommentunify *(ignore the horrible company name, it works and we have more important stuff to discuss)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "First week and the job and the CEO of the next-unicorn-startup that hired you pitches your first task for the company. NASA has discovered that \"Despacito 2\" is on the making and you need to **urgently avoid this scenario.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./media/despacito_nasa.jpg\" alt=\"Miss me yet?\" width=\"500\"/>\n",

    "He doesn't care how you do it or how it works, just that you use fancy trendy eye-catching mind-blowing AI *stuff* to promote Recommentunify's name in the Data Science industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Task\n",
    "After the pitch from the CEO, you talk with your Lead Data Scientist and you get the tasks needed to fulfil the job. The company collected some data on the users, you will need to create the Recommender System that is effective enough so that your users will not need a 2nd version of a Despacito.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Lead DS keeps some of the data as a test set (in which you will estimate production performance) and gives you the remaining data for yourself."

    "### Technical Details - Type Hints\n",
    "Since this specialization focuses on the workflow, we will add a cool new feature of more recent versions of Python called \"Type Hints\". Hints allow you to document the code \"within itself\" and allow for new users and reviewers to better understand what you are doing (consider your future self as a new user when you have to pick up code that you've created a long time ago). This is basically adding the type of the argument after the argument name in the function. You can also hint what should be the return type. If you do not use anything else, Python will not enforce the argument type (will acept as it is), but this is still useful for documentation and debugging.\n",

    "def add_two(x: int) -> int: return x+2\n",
    "\n",
    "print(add_two(2))     # receives int and returns 4, which is an int\n",
    "print(add_two(2.2))   # receives float and returns 4.2 , which is also float (still works)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Details - Docstrings\n",
    "You can make use of the [Docstrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring) to better document your code. There are several styles available. We will use the \"Google Style\" for this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, you can document in a function its overall behaviour (what is used for), what are the expected parameters and returns (along with their types), as well as defining the TODOs for the difficult tasks you are too lazy to code yourself *(future self will be wiser to pick-up on this).*"

    "\n",
    "The files we have available for the **training** stage are:\n",
    "* `train_play_counts.txt` has the listening history for each user\n",
    "* `song_tag.csv`: has the relationship between tags and songs\n",
    "* `songs.txt`: has the correspondence between the song_id (a unique id, eg: SOAAADD12AB018A9DD) and the song_index (an integer index, eg: 1)\n",
    "* `tags.csv`: has the correspondence between the tag_id (a tag name, eg: classic rock) and the tag_index (an integer index, eg: 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **test** stage, we have:\n",

    "* `example_output.csv`: has an example of an output (just for a couple of users)\n",
